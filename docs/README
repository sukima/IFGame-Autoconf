This directory has all the documentation for the game development. Some files
are the text for inside the game which is imported into the game when it is
made (using make)

Developers:
The constructed header files from the text files create a simple procedure you
can call from inside the game. For example:

using make, intro.txt will create intro.h looking somehting like the
following:
    ! This file is generated automatically.
    ! Edit intro.txt to make changes.
    Constant HAVE_introText;
    [ introText;
      print "TEXT TEXT^";
    ];
